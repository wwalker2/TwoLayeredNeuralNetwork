This is a Java program that allows the user to create a multi-layer neural network.
To demonstrate the usage of this program here are the steps to create a three-layer neural network with three neurons per layer.

1.Enter the number 3 as number input values.
2.When choosing the number of layers in the neural network enter 3 again.
3.When choosing the activation function, enter 2 to use the Logistic function.
4.Then enter the number 3 for each individual layer to give them 3 neurons.
5.Next, enter the input values 0.9, 0.1, 0.8.

After all of four steps are completed the neural network will calculate and print the output values from the output layer.
